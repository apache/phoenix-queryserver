<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications. Visit the Apache Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>. This is the repo for the Phoenix Query Server (PQS).

Copyright Â©2020 [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/). All Rights Reserved.

## Building

This repository will build a tarball which is capable of running the Phoenix Query Server.

By default, this tarball does not contain a Phoenix client jar as it is meant to be agnostic
of Phoenix version (one PQS release can be used against any Phoenix version). Today, PQS builds against
the Phoenix 4.15.0-HBase-1.4 release.

Note that the resulting Query Server binaries are not tied to any Phoenix, Hbase or Hadoop versions,
and will work with all recent Phoenix versions.

```
$ mvn clean package
```

### Bundling a Phoenix Client

To build a release of PQS which packages a specific version of Phoenix, specify the `package-phoenix-client` system property
and specify the `phoenix.version` system property to indicate a specific Phoenix version, as well as
the `phoenix.client.artifactid` to choose the phoenix-client HBase variant for 4.16+ / 5.1+.

```
$ mvn clean package -Dpackage.phoenix.client -Dphoenix.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dphoenix.client.artifactid=phoenix-client-hbase-2.4
```

### Running integration tests

`mvn package` will run the unit tests while building, but it will not run the integration test suite.

The IT suite is run when executing `mvn install` or `mvn verify`. The Phoenix client artifact specified
with `phoenix.version` and `phoenix.client.artifactid` is used for running the integration tests.

When specifying `phoenix.version` and `phoenix.client.artifactid`, also specify the HBase version to
be used for integration testing by activating the corresponding `hbase<minor.major>` profile.

When using a Phoenix 5.1+ version, activate the `hbase-2.x` profile in addition to the
profile for the minor 2.x version.

**NOTE** that the integration tests cannot be currently run with Phoenix 4.16+ or 5.1+, so the
examples below will fail. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-6324

```
$ mvn clean verify -Dpackage.phoenix.client -Dphoenix.version=4.16.0-SNAPSHOT -Dphoenix.client.artifactid=phoenix-client-hbase-1.3 -Phbase-1.3
```
```
$ mvn clean install -Dpackage.phoenix.client -Dphoenix.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dphoenix.client.artifactid=phoenix-client-hbase-2.1 -Phbase-2.1 -Phbase-2.x
```

### Running project reports

Phoenix-queryserver currently supports generating the standard set of Maven Project Info Reports,
as well as Spotbugs, Apache Creadur RAT, OWASP Dependency-Check, and Jacoco Code Coverage reports.

To run all available reports
`$ mvn clean verify site -Dspotbugs.site`

To run OWASP, RAT and Spotbugs, but not Jacoco
`$ mvn clean compile test-compile site -Dspotbugs.site`

The reports are accessible via `target/site/index.html`, under the main project,
as well as each of the subprojects. (not every project has all reports)
