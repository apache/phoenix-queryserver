<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications. Visit the Apache Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>. This is the repo for the Phoenix Query Server (PQS).

## Introduction

The Phoenix Query Server is an JDBC over HTTP abstraction. The Phoenix Query Server proxies the standard
Phoenix JDBC driver and provides a backwards-compatible wire protocol to invoke that JDBC driver. This is
all done via the Apache Avatica project (sub-project of Apache Calcite).

The reference client implementation for PQS is a "thin" JDBC driver which can communicate with PQS. There
are drivers in other languages which exist in varying levels of maturity including Python, Golang, and .NET.

The Python driver is maintained by the Phoenix project, and is available in the python-phoenixdb
directory of the phoenix-queryserver repository.
