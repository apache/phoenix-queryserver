<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications. Visit the Apache Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>. This is the repo for the Phoenix Query Server (PQS).

Copyright Â©2020 [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/). All Rights Reserved.

## Introduction

The Phoenix Query Server is an JDBC over HTTP abstraction. The Phoenix Query Server proxies the standard
Phoenix JDBC driver and provides a backwards-compatible wire protocol to invoke that JDBC driver. This is
all done via the Apache Avatica project (sub-project of Apache Calcite).

The reference client implementation for PQS is a "thin" JDBC driver which can communicate with PQS. There
are drivers in other languages which exist in varying levels of maturity including Python, Golang, and .NET.

## Building

This repository will build a tarball which is capable of running the Phoenix Query Server.

By default, this tarball does not contain a Phoenix client jar as it is meant to be agnostic
of Phoenix version (one PQS release can be used against any Phoenix version). Today, PQS builds against
the Phoenix 4.15.0-HBase-1.4 release.

```
$ mvn package
```

### Bundling a Phoenix Client

To build a release of PQS which packages a specific version of Phoenix, enable the `package-phoenix-client` profile
and specify properties to indicate a specific Phoenix version.

By default, PQS will package the same version of Phoenix used for build/test. This version is controlled by the system
property `phoenix.version` system property. Depending on the version of Phoenix, you may also be required to
use the `phoenix.hbase.classifier` system property to identify the correct version of Phoenix built against
the version of HBase of your choosing.

```
$ mvn package -Dpackage.phoenix.client -Dphoenix.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dphoenix.hbase.classifier=hbase-2.2
```
